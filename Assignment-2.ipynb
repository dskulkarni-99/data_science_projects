    "<br>We use machine learning for following reasons:\n",
    "<br>1. Lack of Human Expertise: Machine learning is essential in scenarios where human expertise is limited or unavailable. For instance, when exploring unknown territories, such as uncharted regions of space or deep ocean exploration, machines can be used to make data-driven decisions in environments where human presence and knowledge are constrained or impractical.\n",
    "<br>2. Difficulty in Translating Expertise into Computational Tasks: In some domains, humans possess valuable expertise, but translating that knowledge into computational tasks can be challenging. Machine learning can bridge this gap. For example, in the field of speech recognition, where humans have a deep understanding of spoken language, machine learning algorithms can be employed to convert this expertise into practical, computational tasks like voice commands and automated transcription, enabling more natural human-computer interactions."
